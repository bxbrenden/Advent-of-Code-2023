# Advent of Code 2023
My attempts to solve the Advent of Code for 2023.

This year I chose to explore Kotlin since I've never used it before and want to learn a language that runs on the JVM.
If I fizzle out on any given day, I'll just revert to Python.

I'll use the ⭐ emoji to indicate I solved a puzzle and the ✰ emoji to indicate it's unsolved.
